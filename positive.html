<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1">It is very likely you have COVID-19 and it is important to be under the care of a healthcare provider. It is likely you will be asked to isolate yourself at home to avoid spreading the virus to others. There is a very small chance that this test can give a positive result that is wrong (a false positive). Your healthcare provider will work with you to determine how best to care for you based on your test results along with medical history and your symptoms.</font></p>
